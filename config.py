SkyGuard AI — config.py.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for every rule-engine constant used by BOTH
detect.py (live scoring) and evaluate.py (offline eval). Neither file
defines its own local copies -- everything rule-related lives here.

This file reflects the current architecture: per-rule confidence values
(RULE_BASE_CONFIDENCE) blended with the model score via MODEL_WEIGHT/
RULE_WEIGHT, with RULE_CONFIDENCE_BYPASS/MODEL_ALONE_OVERRIDE_THRESHOLD
as escape hatches for near-certain evidence a pure blend would otherwise
under-weight. The old hard/soft rule-floor cascade is retired (kept
below for the paper trail only, not imported by anything).

===========================================================================
KEEP THIS IN SYNC WITH THE ACTUAL anomaly_injector.py -- READ BEFORE
CHANGING FAIL_LOW_FLOOR / FROZEN_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED
===========================================================================
The injector was rewritten to match real transducer physics (bounded
random-walk frozen values, drift superimposed on the real signal, dual
instant/decay spikes, TRUE hardware-rail fail-low values, and a
Clausius-Clapeyron-grounded multivariate fault). The values below are
calibrated against THAT injector, not an earlier draft:

  - inject_fail_low now writes at FAIL_LOW_RAIL_VALUE (temp=-40.0C,
    pressure=0.0 hPa, humidity=0.0%) plus small fixed jitter -- true
    electrical-rail values, not the old intermediate sentinels
    (-15.0 / 50.0 / 0.5). FAIL_LOW_FLOOR below is a REAL-WORLD
    plausibility boundary (how low a genuine reading could ever get),
    not a "margin above the injector's fault value" -- so it does NOT
    need to track the injector's exact numbers, and the current
    thresholds (-8.0 / 150.0 / 3.0) still correctly catch the new,
    more-extreme rail values with room to spare.
  - inject_frozen holds a value for freeze_length+1 = 7-9 readings
    (rng.integers(6,9) exclusive upper, plus the transition row), but
    the value WANDERS within that window (bounded random-walk ADC
    noise, not a bit-exact hold) -- so window length alone doesn't
    guarantee a long run of identical rounded readings.
  - inject_multivariate's humidity-side fault magnitude is now anchored
    to the physically-correct RH drop implied by the injected temp
    delta (Tetens/Clausius-Clapeyron), not a flat humidity-sigma guess.

===========================================================================
MULTI-PASS PRECISION DRIVE (Pass 1-4) -- empirical calibration notes:
Eval confirmed the following root causes for the 5000+ FP regime:

  (A) MULTIVARIATE FPs (2022 on 25 clean stations): MULTIVARIATE_VAPOR_
      CONSISTENCY_THRESHOLD=8.0 fired on 1.8% of real monsoon weather
      readings. Injected fault VPD mean=25, all injected rows >15.
      Raised to 15.0 -- clean station FPs drop to ~0.1%, injected recall
      unaffected (all injected VPDs well above 15).

  (B) PRESSURE FROZEN FPs (2103 of 2987 total frozen FPs): Real Indian
      barometric pressure is so stable hour-to-hour that np.floor() 1 hPa
      bins accumulate long streaks (streak>=5 fires 81 times on ONE clean
      station). Injected pressure frozen events almost never clear streak>=5
      (7% recall). Conclusion: pressure frozen detection as implemented is
      dominated by FPs with near-zero TP contribution. Raised pressure
      FROZEN_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED_PRESSURE to 8 (only the most extreme
      stable episodes still fire) while keeping temp/humidity at 4.

  (C) MODEL OVERRIDE FPs: MODEL_ALONE_OVERRIDE_THRESHOLD=80 allows the
      Isolation Forest to flag ~15% of clean rows. Raised to 90 so the
      model must be highly confident before overriding rules alone.

  (D) FUSION FPs: FUSION_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD=55 meant any moderate model
      score + any low-confidence rule (e.g. multivariate_single at 45)
      triggered: 0.6*70 + 0.4*45 = 60 > 55. Raised to 68.

  (E) DRIFT FPs: Verified that CUSUM_DIRECTION_STREAK_REQUIRED=8 is
      adequate -- only 26 drift FPs on clean stations, already low.

All config changes are to THIS FILE ONLY. detect.py and evaluate.py
are not touched; they read these constants directly.
