"""
SkyGuard AI — simulator.py: drives the live/demo data stream.

TWO MODES, switched by the whole system at once (not per-station):

  LIVE (default): fetches CURRENT real weather from Open-Meteo for
  each station's real coordinates. No faults -- genuine, unsupervised
  detection against real present-day conditions. This is the actual
  production behavior.

  REPLAY (demo/simulator mode): steps through all 20 *_labeled.csv
  files in lockstep at live cadence. These already contain real
  injected faults with known ground truth (anomaly_injector.py) --
  detect.py scores each reading BLIND, exactly as it would any other
  reading, and whatever it flags is a genuine model detection, not a
  scripted/faked frontend event. This replaces an earlier design that
  reimplemented fault shapes live; that's been removed -- there's no
  reason to reinvent faults when validated labeled data already exists.

MODE SWITCH VIA EXISTING CONTRACT: the frontend's POST
/api/inject-anomaly button ({station_id, type} -> {anomaly_id,
message}) is the only trigger the frontend already has wired, and the
frontend doc explicitly prohibits inventing new endpoints. So that
route (wired in main.py, not here) calls SimulatorState.start_replay(),
which switches the WHOLE system into replay mode -- station_id/type
are accepted for contract-shape compatibility but not used to target
a single station, since replay always drives all 20 simultaneously
from their own pre-injected faults. Replay auto-reverts to LIVE once
every labeled file is exhausted. If per-station/per-type targeting is
actually wanted instead, this needs revisiting -- flagging the
assumption rather than guessing further.

LIVE-FETCH CAVEAT: the exact Open-Meteo "current conditions" call
below is written to the pattern data_fetch.py's archive-history call
likely follows (same station coordinates from stations_metadata.csv),
but I don't have data_fetch.py in context to confirm the exact
endpoint/params it uses. Verify _fetch_live_reading against your real
data_fetch.py before relying on it -- the shape may need adjusting.

============================================================================
PATCH (this pass): REPLAY -> LIVE was silently skipping state.py's own
purge fix. THIS IS THE ACTUAL BUG YOU FLAGGED.
============================================================================
The old start_replay()/_stop_replay() each did:

    self.manager = StateManager(self.metadata, self.manager.artifact)

-- i.e. they THREW AWAY the old StateManager and built a brand new one
from scratch, instead of calling the mode-switch methods state.py's own
rewrite was specifically built to provide (StateManager.start_replay() /
switch_to_live()). This mattered for one concrete reason:

  StateManager.__init__ does `self.history = history_store or
  HistoryStore()`. A freshly constructed HistoryStore() still points at
  the SAME on-disk DATA_DIR/data/history/ -- it's not a fresh sandbox,
  it's the exact same per-station CSV files the old manager was writing
  to. So building a new StateManager did NOT clear anything on disk.
  It just meant switch_to_live()'s actual fix -- purging every
  source="replay" row via HistoryStore.clear_all(source="replay") --
  never ran at all, on either transition. Replay's synthetic injected
  anomalies were left sitting permanently in the same file live rows
  get appended to, EXACTLY the bleed-through bug state.py's own rewrite
  was supposed to close. The only thing hiding it was
  get_station_history()'s defensive `source == self.mode` READ-TIME
  filter, which state.py's own docstring explicitly says is a second
  layer, "not a replacement for" the real purge.

  Rebuilding StateManager from scratch also meant every mode transition
  was silently O(this-run-only) instead of using the reset methods that
  actually integrate with HistoryStore correctly.

FIXED: both transitions now call self.manager.start_replay() /
self.manager.switch_to_live() on the SAME long-lived manager instance.
The manager (and its one HistoryStore) is now created ONCE, in
SimulatorState.__init__, and never rebuilt for the life of the process.

ALSO FIXED:
  - Import path: state.py lives at the backend root (imports bare
    `from config import ...` / `from history_store import HistoryStore`
    -- both root-level modules, not `model/`-prefixed), not inside
    model/. `from model.state import StateManager` would ImportError.
    Corrected to `from state import StateManager`; the sys.path append
    up to the parent of model/ is no longer needed for this import
    specifically but is left in place since detect.py/train.py's own
    `from model.X import Y` pattern still needs it if this file ever
    imports those directly.
  - Removed the duplicate `self.mode` string SimulatorState was
    tracking independently of StateManager.mode. Two independent mode
    trackers on two different objects is exactly the kind of "two
    derivations of the same fact that can silently drift apart" bug
    this project has hit before (see features.py's RULE_ONLY_PREFIXES
    comment, state.py/detect.py's threshold-drift postmortem). `.mode`
    is now a read-only property proxying self.manager.mode, so there is
    exactly one source of truth and any external caller (e.g. a status
    endpoint in main.py) reading sim_state.mode keeps working unchanged.
