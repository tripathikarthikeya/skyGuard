long-horizon history, per-reading baseline exclusion fix, instant
force-recovery).

============================================================================
BUGS THIS REWRITE FIXES (reported directly, against the running system)
============================================================================

1. REPLAY -> LIVE BLEED-THROUGH (the actual production bug you hit).
   The replay/"inject anomaly" endpoint drives historical data through
   the EXACT SAME ingest_reading() path live data uses -- by design,
   that's what makes replay render identically to live on the
   dashboard. But that also means replay's synthetic anomalies, fake
   OFFLINE sensors, CUSUM accumulators, and 10h/24h health counters
   were all landing in the SAME per-station buffers live data reads.
   There was no way to (a) interrupt replay mid-stream and switch to
   live instantly, or (b) clear those buffers when replay ended --
   so live mode inherited replay's contaminated state, and the only
   fix was restarting the server process.

   FIXED: an explicit `StateManager.mode` ("live"/"replay") plus
   `switch_to_live()` / `start_replay()`, each of which resets EVERY
   station's short-window in-memory detection state (§A below) but
   never touches persisted history (§B below). main.py's replay loop
   needs one small change to cooperate with this -- see "MAIN.PY
   INTEGRATION" at the bottom of this docstring, since that file isn't
   in this pass's scope but the interrupt only works if the loop checks
   for it.

2. NO WORKING "FORCE RECOVERY". `mark_repaired()` existed but only
   touched STATION-level aggregate attributes (`.status`,
   `.offline_reason`, `._clean_streak`) -- never the real PER-PARAMETER
   state detect.py's SensorHealthTracker actually decides `.status`
   from (`param_status`, per-parameter clean streaks, the 10h/24h
   deques). This was already flagged as a known gap in detect.py's own
   docstring (#8) before this pass. Practical effect: a "repaired"
   sensor could flip straight back to OFFLINE on its very next reading,
   because its per-parameter counters were untouched and still full of
   pre-repair anomalous readings -- which is almost certainly what
   "it just remains stuck unless we restart the server" was, on top of
   bug #1.

   Two separate methods now exist, kept deliberately distinct:
     - `mark_repaired()` -- for a genuine operator-confirmed physical
       repair. GRADUAL: starts a monitored clean-reading streak before
       trusting the sensor again (unchanged behavior), but now ALSO
       resets the per-parameter state underneath it, so it can't
       silently un-repair itself on the next reading.
     - `force_recover()` -- NEW. INSTANT override, no waiting period.
       This is Draft 2 §6's own Frontend TODO ("a manual force recovery
       action... should immediately flip the sensor back to HEALTHY").
       Use this for "this sensor is stuck in a bad state that isn't a
       real fault" -- e.g. any stuck-offline artifact from before this
       fix existed, or any other stuck state that shouldn't require a
       server restart to clear.

3. PER-READING BASELINE EXCLUSION WAS TOO COARSE. The exclusion gate
   used to be ONLY `health.should_include_in_baseline()` -- a
   whole-sensor-OFFLINE check. A lone spike that never pushes a sensor
   OFFLINE on its own (the normal case for an isolated spike, per §3 of
   the architecture doc) was NOT excluded from anything: its extreme
   value sat inside the next ~48h of rolling-mean/rolling-std
   calculations, quietly degrading later spike sensitivity. This was
   flagged in the prior review as a real architectural hole, not just
   an eval nuance.

   FIXED (see StationBuffer.record_raw_reading): the exclusion gate is
   now PER-READING -- a row is excluded if the sensor is OFFLINE, OR if
   THIS reading's own verdict was is_anomaly=True, OR if a repair is in
   progress. This is still a whole-ROW exclusion (all 3 parameters
   excluded together even if only one fired) -- true per-parameter
   exclusion needs columnar buffering (3 independent per-parameter
   history buffers instead of one combined row buffer), which is a
   bigger change flagged here but not done in this pass, to keep this
   pass scoped to the two gaps actually reported plus the mode-switch
   fix you asked for.

============================================================================
§A -- TWO SEPARATE STORAGE TIERS (do not conflate these)
============================================================================
  SHORT-WINDOW DETECTION BUFFER (`StationBuffer._raw_rows`, in-memory
  deque, ~60h -- see RAW_HISTORY_MAXLEN_HOURS): feeds
  build_features_for_latest/score_reading's rolling-window math
  directly. This is SCRATCH state, mode-scoped -- wiped on every
  switch_to_live()/start_replay() call. Never read this for anything
  frontend-facing; it exists purely to feed detection math and its
  lifetime is intentionally short and mode-bound.

  LONG-HORIZON PERSISTED HISTORY (history_store.HistoryStore,
  CSV-backed, up to 30 days, one file per station -- see
  history_store.py): every ingested reading (live OR replay, tagged by
  a `source` column) is appended here regardless of health/offline
  state, and is NEVER reset by a mode switch. This is what
  get_station_history() below serves to the frontend, and it's also
  where the fault_type/suggested_value-on-hover data now lives -- see
  history_store.py's own docstring for the full schema.

============================================================================
§B -- FRONTEND GAPS THIS CLOSES (backend side only -- frontend still
needs to actually wire the hover tooltip up to this data)
============================================================================
The dashboard graph currently doesn't show, on hovering an anomalous
point: (1) the suggested/predicted value the system would have
substituted, (2) the fault_type. Both were already computed by
score_reading() per-reading, but were only ever returned to the one
live caller of that one ingest_reading() call -- there was nowhere to
re-fetch them for a past point once it scrolled off. get_station_history()
now returns both for every retained point (see its docstring for the
exact per-point shape), specifically so a hover event on any point
within the retention window can render both without the frontend or
state.py needing to keep unbounded history in memory.

============================================================================
MAIN.PY INTEGRATION (flagged -- main.py isn't in this pass's scope, but
the mode switch only works end-to-end if main.py cooperates)
============================================================================
  - Before starting a replay run: call `state_manager.start_replay()`.
  - Inside the replay loop, check `state_manager.mode` on EVERY
    iteration (e.g. `if state_manager.mode != "replay": break`) so an
    in-progress replay can actually be interrupted by a frontend
    "switch to live" request instead of running to completion
    regardless. Without this check, switch_to_live() still resets the
    buffers correctly, but a still-running replay loop will immediately
    start re-populating them with replay data again on its very next
    iteration.
  - When a "switch to live" request arrives (whether replay is still
    running or already finished): call `state_manager.switch_to_live()`.
  - Expose `state_manager.mode` on whatever status endpoint the
    frontend polls, so the UI can show which mode is currently active.

        Frontend-facing query for the trend graph and hover tooltip.
        Reads from HistoryStore (persists across mode switches, up to
        HistoryStore.max_days), NEVER from the live detection buffer --
        see module docstring §A for why those two must stay separate.

        Returns a list of dicts, one per retained reading, each shaped:
            {
              "timestamp": ..., "station_id": ...,
              "temperature_c": ..., "pressure_hpa": ..., "humidity_pct": ...,
              "is_anomaly": bool,
              "fault_type": str | None,
              "severity": str,
              "anomaly_score_pct": float,
              "suggested_temperature_c": float | None,
              "suggested_pressure_hpa": float | None,

        FRONTEND TODO (backend side is now done): on hovering an
        anomalous point on the trend graph, show `fault_type` and the
        `suggested_<param>` value for whichever series is being
        hovered -- both are present on every retained point now, not
        just the instant it was first scored.

        include_replay: False (default) -- rows are additionally
        filtered to `source == self.mode` before returning, so the
        live dashboard can NEVER render a replay run's synthetic
        anomalies. Durable replay rows remain available through the
        operator CSV export, but are intentionally absent from normal
        live graph queries. Only
        pass True for a deliberate "review the last replay run" debug
        view, if one ever gets built; normal dashboard traffic should
        never set this.

# DEFERRED (see 6-hour scoping decision, still true after this pass):
# full HEALTHY -> SUSPICIOUS -> FAULTY -> REPAIRED -> RECOVERY state
# machine, retrospective cleanup of already-buffered contaminated
# readings, spatial-baseline volatility z-scoring, true per-parameter
# (columnar) baseline exclusion. Current scope: HEALTHY/WARNING/OFFLINE
# (from detect.py's SensorHealthTracker) + per-reading real-time
# exclusion + reading-count based AND instant force recovery + mode-
# aware buffer lifecycle + persisted long-horizon history. Sufficient
# for main.py/simulator.py to work correctly now; upgrade path
# documented above for the roadmap slide.
