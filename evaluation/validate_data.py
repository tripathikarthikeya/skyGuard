"""
SkyGuard AI — Phase 1a.5: Data quality validation.

Runs AFTER data_fetch.py, BEFORE anomaly_injector.py.

Open-Meteo's historical archive is reanalysis data (model-blended, not
raw sensor telemetry), so it's already smoothed and quality-controlled
upstream -- genuine sensor-style glitches (spikes, frozen values,
dropouts) are very unlikely to already be in it. That's actually
convenient: we want "normal" training data to genuinely mean normal,
since we inject all fault behavior ourselves in a controlled way.

What CAN still slip in, and what this script actually checks for:
  - missing/NaN readings (gaps in the API response)
  - duplicate timestamps (known edge case in some reanalysis sources)
  - physically impossible values (interpolation/boundary artifacts)

This is a validation GATE, not a silent auto-fixer: it reports what it
finds and fixes only the narrow, safe cases (small gaps via
interpolation, exact duplicate rows via dropping). Anything larger or
ambiguous is flagged loudly rather than silently patched, because
silently "cleaning" data you're about to call ground-truth "normal" is
exactly the kind of thing that should require a human to look at it.
